                    Ever since I was a toddler I have always had a huge interest in cars, electronics, computers and just technology in general.

                    When I was about 10 I managed to get my hands on an old computer that I took up to my room and disassembled completely and that went great,
                    until I tried to assemble it back togeheter lets just say that it did not work after that!

                    Around the age of 13 was very interested in how websites and applications worked and how they were made,
                    I bought a book about C++ programming which might not have been the best starting point for a 13 year old but I read it through and console based text game and I have not stopped programming since!

                    During the years I tried out a bunch of different programming languages and today have decent knowledge in .NET, PHP, Lua, C++ Javascript (NodeJS & regular), HTML, CSS and Java.
                    I really like to try out and learn new languages, frameworks and tools!

                    On my freetime I have a couple of things that I enjoy doing, I have and old BMW E36 that is a project car and the plans is to do a complete renovation of both the body and engine.
                    I also enjoy going for long drives without any destination, usually I just pick the first road I see and follow it to see where I end up.

                    The last 2 things I love to do is playing online games with my friends and to work on my own small projects,
                    currently I'm working on a small React Native application that hooks into an app called Snapchat and save images that are recived and bypass the screenshot detection without notifying the user.
